UI CUSTOMIZATION
1.git clone https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet 
2.Navigate to the react folder
3.For UI buttons customization, edit features/toolbox/components/native/Toolbox.js
4.You can edit other Js files within the native subfolder for various customizations.

REBUILDING THE JITSI SDK.

Once you are done with the UI customization, you cn rebuild the jitsi-sdk to reflect those changes in your native android/ios app.For android:

1)Navigate to the root of the cloned repository.
2) run 'npm install' to pull all the react-native dependencies
3)create a folder /tmp/repo in your UNIX(linux or  mac os).For windows this operations won't work
4)run ./android/scripts/release-sdk.sh /tmp/repo  .(Ensure you have maven installed on your machine)

Once the the script executes succesfully,You're now ready to use the artifacts.
You can use your local repository to replace the Jitsi repository (maven { url "https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-maven-repository/raw/master/releases" }) when you published all subprojects.

 In your project, add the Maven repository that you used above (/tmp/repo) into your top-level build.gradle file:

allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "file:/tmp/repo" }
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
}


Then, define the dependency org.jitsi.react:jitsi-meet-sdk into the build.gradle file of your module:
implementation ('org.jitsi.react:jitsi-meet-sdk:+') { transitive = true }.
